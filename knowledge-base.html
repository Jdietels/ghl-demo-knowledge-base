Detailed Customer Queries & Answers\n\n**Q: Do I have a case?**  \nA: Personal injury cases require proof of another party’s fault, damages (such as medical bills, lost wages, pain and suffering), and causation. A preliminary evaluation considers the facts of your incident, available evidence, and applicable laws. Schedule a consultation for a detailed assessment.\n\n**Q: How long will my case take?**  \nA: Timelines vary. Straightforward claims may resolve in months; complex or litigated cases can take years. Factors include injury severity, liability disputes, insurance company cooperation, and court schedules.\n\n**Q: What if I was partially at fault?**  \nA: Many jurisdictions follow comparative negligence rules, allowing recovery reduced by your percentage of fault. Some states bar recovery if you are 50% or more at fault.\n\n**Q: What fees do you charge?**  \nA: Most personal injury attorneys work on a contingency fee (typically 25-40%), meaning no payment unless you win. Consultations may be free or billed as a flat fee; costs for records, filing, or experts are usually deducted from the settlement.\n\n**Q: What if the insurance company denies my claim?**  \nA: Attorneys can appeal denials, file lawsuits, or negotiate alternative resolutions. Evidence strengthening and legal argumentation are key at this juncture.\n\n**Q: Can I settle out of court?**  \nA: Yes, most cases settle without trial. Settlement avoids court risks and delays, but it’s crucial to ensure the offer fully accounts for all damages.\n\n**Q: Will my medical bills be paid?**  \nA: Medical liens may be placed by providers pending settlement. Your attorney negotiates lien reductions and coordinates payments from proceeds.\n\n**Q: What is the statute of limitations?**  \nA: This is the legal deadline to file your claim, varying by state (commonly 1-3 years from injury/discovery). Missing it generally bars recovery.\n\n**Q: What documents do I need?**  \nA: Accident reports, medical records, bills, insurance information, wage statements, photographs, and witness contact details.\n\n**Edge Case Q: The at-fault driver fled the scene (hit-and-run). What now?**  \nA: File a police report, seek immediate medical treatment, notify your insurer, and consult an attorney. Uninsured motorist coverage may apply.\n\n**Edge Case Q: Multiple parties may be at fault (e.g., multi-car accident, defective road). How is this handled?**  \nA: All potentially liable parties are investigated and claims are pursued according to their share of fault. Comparative fault laws apply.\n\n---\n\n### 2.4.
