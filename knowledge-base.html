Customer Queries with Detailed Answers\n\n#### Common Queries\n\n**Q: What is the difference between an LLC and a Corporation?**  \nA: An LLC (Limited Liability Company) offers flexible management and pass-through taxation, while a Corporation (C-Corp/S-Corp) is a separate legal entity with stricter formalities and multiple taxation options. LLCs are often preferred for smaller businesses, while Corporations suit businesses seeking venture capital or public offerings.\n\n**Q: What are my annual compliance obligations?**  \nA: Compliance obligations include annual reports, board/shareholder meetings, minutes documentation, tax filings, updating corporate records, and any industry-specific regulatory filings.\n\n**Q: How do I issue stock to new investors?**  \nA: This process requires board approval, amending the cap table, drafting subscription agreements, issuing stock certificates or electronic records, and ensuring compliance with securities laws (e.g., Regulation D exemptions in the US).\n\n**Q: Can I remove a director or officer?**  \nA: Removal processes are governed by corporate bylaws or statutes. Generally, shareholders can remove directors with or without cause, subject to notice and quorum requirements.\n\n**Q: What is due diligence in M&A?**  \nA: Due diligence is a systematic review of the target companyâ€™s legal, financial, operational, and compliance status to identify risks before a transaction. It typically involves document review, interviews, and regulatory checks.\n\n#### Edge-Case Queries\n\n**Q: How do we handle a hostile takeover attempt from a foreign entity?**  \nA: Implement defensive measures (e.g., poison pill provisions), engage external legal counsel, communicate with shareholders, and notify relevant regulatory authorities (such as CFIUS for US companies).\n\n**Q: What are the legal implications of launching an ICO (Initial Coin Offering)?**  \nA: Jurisdictions vary; many classify tokens as securities, requiring registration or exemption filings. AML/KYC compliance is critical, and ongoing SEC/FINRA guidance must be monitored.\n\n**Q: How do we address whistleblower complaints alleging board-level misconduct?**  \nA: Activate the whistleblower policy, retain independent counsel to investigate, notify relevant regulatory bodies as required, and document all steps for compliance and transparency.\n\n---\n\n### 2.3.
