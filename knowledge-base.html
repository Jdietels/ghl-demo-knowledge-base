Typical Questions\n**Q: What is the difference between a warranty deed and a quitclaim deed?**  \nA: A warranty deed guarantees the seller holds clear title and has the right to sell, offering protection against future title claims. A quitclaim deed transfers any interest the grantor has in the property but makes no guarantees about title validity.\n\n**Q: What disclosures are required when selling residential property?**  \nA: Requirements vary by state but often include lead paint, structural issues, water damage, and known defects.

Legal action may be required to resolve such claims.\n\n**Q: How do I handle a title defect discovered after purchase?**  \nA: Consult your title insurance policy first. A real estate attorney can file a quiet title action or negotiate with involved parties to cure the defect.\n\n**Q: What happens if a foreign national inherits US property?**  \nA: They may inherit, but tax and reporting obligations arise under FIRPTA.
