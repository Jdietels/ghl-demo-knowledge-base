SAMPLE EDGE-CASE CUSTOMER QUERIES & DETAILED ANSWERS\n\n**Q: I was hit by a driver who fled the scene. I don’t know their identity. Can I still recover compensation?**  \nA: Yes. In Georgia, you can file a claim under your own uninsured motorist (UM) coverage. Promptly notify your insurer and document the incident with a police report. Strict deadlines apply; act quickly.\n\n**Q: My injury happened on government property. Are there special rules?**  \nA: Yes. Georgia law requires you to provide an “ante litem” notice to the government entity, often within 6-12 months of the injury, before filing suit. Failure to do so may bar your claim.\n\n**Q: I signed a waiver before my injury. Does that mean I have no case?**  \nA: Not necessarily. Waivers do not protect parties from gross negligence or intentional harm. Courts scrutinize waivers closely; a lawyer can evaluate enforceability.\n\n**Q: I have a pre-existing back injury. Will that hurt my claim?**  \nA: Not automatically. If the accident aggravated a pre-existing condition, you may still recover compensation for the exacerbation. Medical documentation is crucial.\n\n---\n\n## 5. STEP-BY-STEP TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDES\n\n**A. Client Intake Not Processing**\n\n1. Check for missing required fields in intake form.\n2. Ensure contact info is valid (phone/email).\n3. Confirm no conflict of interest.\n4. Attempt follow-up contact.\n5. If unresolved, flag for human review.\n\n**B. Settlement Offer Dispute**\n\n1. Review insurer’s offer and basis.\n2. Compare to damages and similar case outcomes.\n3. Communicate rationale to client.\n4. Negotiate with adjuster; document all offers.\n5. If impasse, discuss litigation risks/benefits.\n\n**C. Evidence Collection Delay**\n\n1. Identify source of delay (medical provider, police, third party).\n2. Send formal written request; request status updates.\n3. Escalate to supervisor or legal department if needed.\n4. Consider subpoena if litigation filed.\n\n---\n\n## 6.
