The reversing valve enables cooling or heating modes in heat pumps.\n- Common Customer Query: “My AC is running but the house isn’t cooling.” Response outline: verify power, thermostat settings, outdoor unit operation, refrigerant charge, and airflow; if no issue found, schedule a technician; cite safety and potential refrigerant handling rules.\n- Troubleshooting Flow (High-Level): 1) Confirm power and thermostat communication; 2) Check outdoor condensing unit for operation; 3) Inspect air filter and blower; 4) Check refrigerant charge; 5) Inspect controls and wiring; 6) If unresolved, escalate to diagnostic service.\n\nNotes on Undefined Regulations\n- Because HVAC regulations vary widely by jurisdiction and can change, the knowledge base should emphasize: always verify local codes, permits, and AHJ requirements before installation or modification.\n- Use templates and checklists that can be localized per region, and link to official local regulatory resources.\n- Ensure the AI can flag when a response could require local regulatory compliance and prompt escalation to a licensed professional.\n\nHow to Use This Knowledge Base in Practice\n- For developers: Integrate this content with a knowledge graph and semantic search engine; map user queries to canonical intents and entities; use continuous learning pipelines to improve accuracy.\n- For the AI: Rely on the knowledge graph to connect symptoms to root causes and solutions; provide context-aware responses that reference local regulations, warranty considerations, and safety requirements.\n- For trainers: Use scenario-based training with real customer conversations to teach the AI to handle edge cases gracefully, including safety escalations and regulatory constraints.\n\nClosing\nThis knowledge base provides a comprehensive framework for an HVAC-focused AI agent to deliver expert-level guidance across installation, maintenance, diagnostics, safety, and customer interactions. It emphasizes safety, regulatory compliance, region-specific variations, and a robust AI training strategy built on semantic search, knowledge graphs, and continuous learning. If you want, I can tailor this into a machine-readable knowledge base format (JSON, YAML, or a CMS-ready schema) and propose a phased deployment plan with example prompts, intents, and entity definitions.","refusal":null,"annotations":[]},"finish_reason":"stop"}
