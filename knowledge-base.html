Overview of Dental Malpractice Law\n\n- **Definition:** Dental malpractice law is a branch of medical malpractice law dealing with legal claims against dental professionals for injuries resulting from substandard care, negligence, or failure to diagnose/treat oral health issues appropriately.\n- **Scope:** Includes general dentists, dental specialists (orthodontists, endodontists, periodontists, oral surgeons), and dental hygienists.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Industry-Specific Terminology and Concepts\n\n- **Negligence:** Failure to provide the standard of care expected of a competent dentist.\n- **Standard of Care:** The degree of care a reasonably prudent dentist would provide in similar circumstances.\n- **Informed Consent:** Obligation to explain procedures, risks, benefits, and alternatives before treatment.\n- **Causation:** Establishing that the dentist’s conduct directly caused harm.\n- **Damages:** Economic (medical bills, lost wages) and non-economic (pain, suffering) losses.\n- **Statute of Limitations:** Legal deadline for filing a malpractice claim (varies by jurisdiction).\n- **Res Ipsa Loquitur:** Presumption of negligence when injury typically would not occur without negligence.\n- **Contributory/Comparative Negligence:** Patient’s possible role in causing or worsening their injury.\n- **Expert Affidavit/Certificate of Merit:** Legal requirement in some states to file a malpractice suit.\n- **Dental Boards:** State regulatory authorities overseeing dental practice standards.\n- **Common Procedures Involved in Claims:** Extractions, root canals, anesthesia administration, implants, orthodontics, cosmetic procedures.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\n**Q1: What qualifies as dental malpractice?**  \nA: Dental malpractice occurs when a dentist deviates from the accepted standard of care, resulting in injury. Examples include misdiagnosis, improper treatment, surgical errors, anesthesia complications, or failure to detect oral diseases.\n\n**Q2: What is the statute of limitations for dental malpractice?**  \nA: This varies by state, generally ranging from 1 to 3 years from the date of injury or discovery. Some states have “discovery rules” extending the period if the injury was not immediately apparent.\n\n**Q3: What damages can be recovered?**  \nA: Plaintiffs may recover economic damages (medical expenses, lost income) and non-economic damages (pain, suffering, emotional distress). Some states cap non-economic damages.\n\n**Q4: Do I need an expert witness to file a claim?**  \nA: In most jurisdictions, a dental expert must attest that the standard of care was breached, often via a certificate of merit.\n\n**Q5: Can malpractice occur during routine procedures?**  \nA: Yes. Even common treatments like fillings, cleanings, or extractions can involve malpractice if performed negligently.\n\n**Q6: What if I signed a consent form?**  \nA: Informed consent does not protect dentists from liability for negligent acts.\n\n**Q7: Can I sue for pain and suffering?**  \nA: Yes, as part of non-economic damages, subject to state law limitations.\n\n**Q8: What is vicarious liability?**  \nA: Dental practices can be held liable for the negligence of their employees.\n\n**Q9: How long does a lawsuit take?**  \nA: Timelines vary, but dental malpractice suits can take months to several years, depending on complexity and court backlogs.\n\n**Q10: What evidence is needed?**  \nA: Dental records, treatment plans, X-rays, expert testimony, and documentation of injuries and financial losses.\n\n---\n\n## 5.
